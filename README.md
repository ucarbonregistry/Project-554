The proposed project titled under UCR is “14.335 MW Bundled Solar Power Projects by Jay International.”
This bundled activity includes grid-connected, ground-mounted Solar PV installations located across two
Indian states.

In the state of Gujarat, the project is situated in Jamnagar District, covering the following locations: Dhudasiya
and Modpar villages in Taluka: Jamnagar; Moti Matli village in Taluka: Kalawad; and Khiri village in Taluka:
Jodiya.
In the state of Maharashtra, the project is located in Nashik District, specifically at Musalgaon village in Sinnar
Taluka.
This is an operational project that consistently reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is currently being
registered under the Universal Carbon Registry (UCR).

Purpose of the project activity:

The proposed bundled project comprises grid-connected, ground-mounted Solar PV installations with a
total installed capacity of 14.335 MW. The electricity generated under this bundled solar initiative is
distributed through two distinct mechanisms:

(i) A portion is allocated for captive use by designated industrial and commercial consumers through
wheeling agreements with the grid, and

(ii) The remaining capacity is utilized for sale to third-party consumers under long-term Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) or through open access arrangements, depending on the regional regulatory
framework.

The project has been conceptualized and promoted as a bundled solar initiative by the Project Proponent
(PP), in collaboration with the entities listed below.
Jay International, a Gujarat-based manufacturer of brass components, has been duly authorized by several
co-located solar project owners to serve as their representative for the purpose of project submission,
coordination, and ongoing management under the carbon credit project, ensuring compliance and
coordination with the relevant processes.

The bundled solar project includes entities located in Jamnagar district, Gujarat, all of which operate under
Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd. (PGVCL) through executed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and
Wheeling Agreements for the sale and transmission of solar electricity.

In contrast, the project component located in Nashik district, Maharashtra i.e. Ashoka Institute of Medical
Sciences and Research functions under the Open Access mechanism, facilitated by the Maharashtra State
Electricity Transmission Company Ltd. (MSECL). This allows the institute to directly procure solar electricity
for captive use across the state grid infrastructure.
